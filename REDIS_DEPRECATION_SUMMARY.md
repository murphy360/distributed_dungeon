# Redis Deprecation Summary

## Overview
Redis has been fully deprecated from the Distributed Dungeon system in favor of a fully distributed architecture where each character container is completely self-contained.

## Changes Made

### Main System (docker-compose.yml)
- ✅ **Redis service**: Commented out and deprecated
- ✅ **Redis dependencies**: Removed from all services (dungeon-master, dungeon, monster, communication, rules-engine)
- ✅ **Redis URLs**: Removed from all service environment variables
- ✅ **Redis Commander**: Commented out and deprecated  
- ✅ **Redis volume**: Removed from volumes section
- ✅ **Player service**: Deprecated (was using non-existent database tables)

### Character Containers
- ✅ **Character deployment**: Updated `docker-compose.characters.yml` to remove Redis containers
- ✅ **Base character**: Updated `docker-compose.yml` to remove Redis service and dependencies
- ✅ **Environment variables**: Replaced Redis URL with file-based state management configuration

## Remaining Tasks

### Code Updates Needed
1. **Character container source code** (`services/character/src/`):
   - Update `index.js` to remove Redis configuration
   - Update `communication/events.js` to use HTTP-based event system instead of Redis pub/sub
   - Implement file-based state management using JSON files in `/app/data/`

2. **Production configuration** (`docker-compose.prod.yml`):
   - Remove Redis URLs from all production services
   - Update production character container configurations

3. **Documentation updates**:
   - Update README files to remove Redis references
   - Update `.env.example` files to remove Redis configurations
   - Update deployment guides

### Architecture Benefits
- **Simplified deployment**: No Redis dependency to manage
- **True distribution**: Each character is completely independent
- **Reduced complexity**: Direct HTTP communication between services
- **Better isolation**: Character state is local to each container
- **Easier scaling**: No centralized cache bottleneck

## Migration Notes
- All character state will now be stored in local JSON files within each character container
- Inter-service communication uses direct HTTP API calls instead of Redis pub/sub
- Character containers use persistent volumes for state files (`/app/data/character-state.json`)
- Main system services communicate directly via their exposed HTTP APIs

## File-Based State Management
Each character container now uses:
- `STATE_STORAGE_TYPE=file`
- `STATE_FILE_PATH=/app/data/character-state.json`
- Persistent volume: `character-data:/app/data`

This provides durability without external dependencies while maintaining full container independence.
