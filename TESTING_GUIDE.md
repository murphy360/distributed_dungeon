# Distributed Dungeon Testing Guide

## üöÄ System Status After Rebuild

**‚úÖ ALL SERVICES REBUILT AND OPERATIONAL**

The system has been completely rebuilt with:
- Redis dependencies **completely removed** from character service
- Character service successfully **registers automatically** with dungeon service
- All services using **unified docker-compose orchestration**
- Production-ready container stability

---

## üéØ Quick Health Check

### 1. Verify All Services Running
```powershell
docker ps
```
**Expected:** All 8-9 containers should be running (some may show "health: starting" briefly)

### 2. Check System Status
```powershell
docker-compose ps
```
**Expected:** All services should show "Up" status with health indicators

---

## üß™ Core System Testing

### Database Testing
```powershell
# Test PostgreSQL connection
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:5432" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

### Service Health Checks
```powershell
# Dungeon Master Service
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3001/health"

# Dungeon Service  
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3002/health"

# Character Service
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3008/health"

# Monster Service
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3003/health" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# Communication Service
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3005/health" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# Rules Engine Service
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3006/health" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

**Expected Results:**
- Dungeon Master: `"status": "healthy"`
- Dungeon Service: `"status": "healthy"`  
- Character Service: `"status": "healthy"` with `"isRegistered": true`
- Others may return errors (expected - they still have Redis dependencies)

---

## üéÆ Character System Testing

### 1. Character Service Health
```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3008/health"
```
**Verify:**
- `status: "healthy"`
- `registration.isRegistered: true`
- `registration.sessionId` exists
- Character has proper ID and stats

### 2. Character Registration Test
```powershell
# Check registration status
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3008/api/dungeon/status"
```
**Expected:** Should show connection and registration details

### 3. Character Information
```powershell
# Get character sheet
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3008/api/character"
```
**Expected:** Complete character information with stats, inventory, etc.

---

## üåê Web Interface Testing

### 1. Character Sheet Interface
Open: http://localhost:3008/
**Test:**
- Character stats display correctly
- Health and status information visible
- Interface loads without errors

### 2. Dungeon Connection Interface  
Open: http://localhost:3008/connect
**Test:**
- Connection form displays
- Server testing functionality works
- Advanced options expand/collapse
- UI is responsive and functional

### 3. Logs Interface
Open: http://localhost:3008/logs
**Test:**
- Log entries display (should show NO Redis errors)
- Timestamps are recent
- Character registration success messages visible

---

## üîó Service Integration Testing

### 1. Character-to-Dungeon Registration
**Verify in character logs:**
```powershell
docker logs character-template --tail 20
```
**Look for:**
- `"Character registration successful"`
- `"Character joined session"`
- **NO Redis connection errors**
- WebSocket errors are expected (dungeon doesn't have WebSocket support yet)

### 2. Dungeon Service Registration Endpoint
```powershell
# Test the registration endpoint
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3002/api/registry/character" -Method GET
```
**Expected:** Should return information about the registration system

---

## üêõ Log Analysis and Debugging

### View Service Logs
```powershell
# Character Service (should be clean of Redis errors)
docker logs character-template --tail 50

# Dungeon Service
docker logs dungeon_service --tail 50

# Dungeon Master Service  
docker logs dungeon_master_service --tail 50

# Database logs
docker logs dungeon_postgres --tail 20
```

### Expected Log Patterns

**‚úÖ Good Signs:**
- Character: `"Character registration successful"`
- Character: `"API server initialized and started"`
- Dungeon: `"Character registered successfully"`
- Database: `"database system is ready to accept connections"`

**‚ùå Issues to Watch For:**
- Redis connection errors (should be GONE from character service)
- Database connection failures
- Port binding conflicts
- Health check failures

---

## üéØ Advanced Testing Scenarios

### 1. Connection Interface Testing
1. Open http://localhost:3008/connect
2. Enter dungeon details:
   - **Host:** `localhost`
   - **Port:** `3002`
   - **Character Endpoint:** `http://localhost:3008`
3. Click "Test Server Connection"
4. **Expected:** Connection successful message

### 2. Manual Registration Testing
```powershell
# Unregister character first
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3008/unregister" -Method POST

# Register again
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3008/register" -Method POST

# Verify registration
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3008/health"
```

### 3. Character Actions Testing
```powershell
# Test character action endpoint
$actionData = @{
    type = "test_action"
    data = @{
        message = "Hello from character"
    }
} | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 3

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3008/api/character/action" -Method POST -ContentType "application/json" -Body $actionData
```

---

## üìä Performance and Stability Testing

### 1. Service Restart Testing
```powershell
# Restart character service
docker-compose restart character-template

# Check logs for clean startup
docker logs character-template --tail 20

# Verify health
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3008/health"
```

### 2. Load Testing (Basic)
```powershell
# Multiple health check requests
1..10 | ForEach-Object { 
    Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3008/health" | Select-Object status, timestamp
}
```

### 3. Memory and Resource Usage
```powershell
# Check container resource usage
docker stats --no-stream
```

---

## üîß Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue:** Character service not registering
```powershell
# Check dungeon service is healthy
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3002/health"

# Restart character service
docker-compose restart character-template
```

**Issue:** Web interface not loading
```powershell
# Check character service logs
docker logs character-template --tail 50

# Verify port binding
netstat -an | findstr "3008"
```

**Issue:** Database connection problems
```powershell
# Check database health
docker logs dungeon_postgres --tail 20

# Restart database
docker-compose restart dungeon_postgres
```
