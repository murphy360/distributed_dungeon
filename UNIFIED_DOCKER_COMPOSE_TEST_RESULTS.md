# Unified Docker Compose Test Results

## Test Overview
Date: October 6, 2025
Objective: Test the newly unified docker-compose.yml file after Redis deprecation and service consolidation

## 🎯 Test Results Summary

### ✅ **Successfully Accomplished**
1. **Container Orchestration**: Main docker-compose.yml properly orchestrates all services
2. **Database Service**: PostgreSQL starts healthy and accessible
3. **Service Dependencies**: Services respect dependency chains (database health checks work)
4. **Character Service Integration**: Character service successfully added to main compose with profile support
5. **Network Configuration**: Docker networking functions correctly
6. **Volume Management**: Persistent volumes created properly

### ❌ **Issues Discovered**
1. **Redis Client Connections**: Services still contain Redis client code trying to connect to `dungeon_redis`
2. **Service Health Checks**: Multiple services failing health checks due to Redis connection errors
3. **UUID Database Errors**: Some services have database query issues (UUID format errors)

## 📊 **Container Status Results**

| Service | Status | Health | Issue |
|---------|--------|--------|-------|
| `dungeon_postgres` | ✅ Running | ✅ Healthy | None |
| `dungeon_master_service` | ✅ Running | ✅ Healthy | None |
| `dungeon_service` | ❌ Running | ❌ Unhealthy | Redis connection errors |
| `monster_service` | ❌ Running | ❌ Unhealthy | Redis connection errors |
| `communication_service` | ❌ Running | ❌ Unhealthy | Redis connection errors |
| `rules_engine_service` | ❌ Running | ❌ Unhealthy | Redis connection errors |
| `character-template` | ⏸️ Created | ⏸️ Not Started | Dependency failed |
| `dungeon_nginx` | ❌ Restarting | ❌ Unhealthy | Dependent services unhealthy |

## 🔧 **Required Fixes**

### 1. Service Source Code Updates
**Priority: HIGH**
- Remove Redis client initialization from all service source code
- Replace Redis operations with:
  - In-memory caching for session data
  - File-based persistence for important state
  - Direct HTTP API calls between services

**Affected Services:**
- `services/dungeon/src/` - Redis client connections
- `services/monster/src/` - Redis client connections  
- `services/communication/src/` - Redis client connections
- `services/rules-engine/src/` - Redis client connections
- `services/character/src/` - Redis client connections

### 2. Database Schema Issues
**Priority: MEDIUM**
- Fix UUID parameter formatting in database queries
- Ensure database migrations are properly applied

### 3. Health Check Dependencies
**Priority: LOW**  
- Review service health check endpoints
- Ensure health checks don't depend on Redis connectivity

## 🎉 **Successful Validations**

### Docker Compose Architecture
- ✅ Single unified docker-compose.yml works correctly
- ✅ Profile-based character service deployment (`--profile character`)
- ✅ Service dependency management (database health checks)
- ✅ Volume and network configuration
- ✅ Environment variable handling

### Redis Deprecation Infrastructure
- ✅ No Redis service in docker-compose
- ✅ No Redis environment variables in compose
- ✅ Redis volumes removed from compose
- ✅ Services can start without Redis container

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Implement File-Based State Management**
   - Update service source code to remove Redis clients
   - Add local JSON file state management
   - Test individual service functionality

2. **Database Schema Validation**
   - Check database migrations
   - Fix UUID query formatting issues

3. **Full System Integration Test**
   - Test service-to-service HTTP communication
   - Validate character container integration
   - Perform end-to-end functionality testing

## 📋 **Testing Commands Used**

```bash
# Stop all existing containers
docker-compose down --remove-orphans
docker stop $(docker ps -aq); docker rm $(docker ps -aq)

# Test unified compose
docker-compose up -d database        # Database first
docker-compose up -d                 # All core services
docker-compose --profile character up -d character  # Character service

# Diagnostics
docker ps -a                         # Container status
docker logs dungeon_service          # Error investigation
```

## 🏁 **Conclusion**

The unified docker-compose.yml architecture is **structurally sound** and successfully orchestrates the distributed dungeon system. The main remaining work is updating the service source code to complete the Redis removal and implement file-based state management.

**Architecture Status: ✅ READY FOR CODE UPDATES**
**Redis Deprecation: 🔄 IN PROGRESS (infrastructure complete, code updates needed)**
